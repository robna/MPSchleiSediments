# MPSchleiSediments
## Data analysis of microplastics data from Schlei fjord sediments.

Part of the project [BONUS MicroPoll](https://www.io-warnemuende.de/micropoll-home.html)

First, run the scripts from the MPDB_scripts folder.
It loads the available data from the [MPDB database](https://www.io-warnemuende.de/tl_files/project/micropoll/Deliverables/call2015-122_D1.2_0.2.pdf) and performs the blank/blind-removal procedure.
The resulting (shortened) data is saved in the csv folder.
From there it will be imported from the following analysis scripts.

Then, start the analysis by running the analysis.ipynb notebook in the analysis folder.
